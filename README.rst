Otter convergence
=================

Example implementation of `convergence <https://github.com/rackerlabs/otter/blob/master/otter/convergence>`_ in Haskell. 
This is for learning purpose only. I am currently focussing on implementing ``converge`` function.
I might add steps execution sometime later.

TODO:
-----

- CLB draining
- RCv3 - common code for both LBs as it is currently being `worked <https://github.com/rackerlabs/otter/issues/821>`_ on
- Tests
