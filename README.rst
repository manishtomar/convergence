Otter convergence
=================

Example implementation of `convergence <https://github.com/rackerlabs/otter/blob/master/otter/convergence>`_ in Haskell. 
This is for learning purpose only. I am currently focussing on implementing ``converge`` function.
I might add steps execution sometime later.
